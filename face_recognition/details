This is code for face recognition, although there are many ways we can achieve this using pretrained models like VGG16, VGG19 and others.
due to lack to computation power on my machine I decided to build my own classifier(model).
you will get the model in this file : face_detect_own_model
by using face_recog code you can recognize the faces.

your training set should be in the format like below:
train_dataset\(no of folders for you want the classification)
I have not included folders of training as it was too big and I also not provided the tranined model as it is of no use for other people.
in case of any issue you can reach out to me anytime.
Happy to Help :-)
